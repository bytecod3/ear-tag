Ear tag with LORA

## Introduction 
This proejct implements a catle ear tag using LORA technology. The purpose of the tag is to monitor location and activity of the 
cattle. It is tailored to open ranch setups where the cattle have a huge chunk of land to graze.

This ear tag also monitors the activity level of the cattle and uses a custom algrithm to detect shcok and abnormal vibrations 
to tell whether the animal fell, is still lying down etc.

## How it works
The device reads accelerations from an accelerometer sensor and does data processing to translate them into useful data like shock and activity levels.
Using a GPS, we can monitor the real-time location of the animal. 

This data is transmitted to a base station via a LORA gateway and visualized on the farmer's device, either 
phone and/or desktop setup.

### Pitch and roll calculation 
Acceleration is read from all axes(x, y, z). The read values are then used 
to calculate the pitch and roll angles as shown below.  
#### Pitch calculation
```c
pitch = arcsine(x_acceleration_in_ms)
```
#### Roll calculation 
```c
roll = atan2(y_aceleration_in_ms, z_acceleration_in_ms)
```

### Resultant acceleration calculation
